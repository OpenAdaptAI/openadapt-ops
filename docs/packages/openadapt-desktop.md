Cross-platform desktop app for continuous screen recording and AI training data collection, built for [OpenAdapt](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/OpenAdapt).

## What is OpenAdapt Desktop?

OpenAdapt Desktop captures desktop activity -- screen recordings, mouse events, keyboard events, window metadata, and optionally audio -- for training AI agents via demonstration.

The Python engine works as a **standalone CLI** today. A Tauri-based system tray app (macOS, Windows, Linux) is planned for a future release.

**Key principles:**

- **Raw recordings stay local** -- nothing leaves your machine without explicit review and approval
- **Human-in-the-loop scrubbing** -- PII detection and redaction with before/after comparison
- **Build-time trust guarantees** -- enterprise builds physically exclude upload code paths
- **Multiple upload backends** -- S3, HuggingFace Hub, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, Magic Wormhole, or federated learning

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
git clone https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-desktop.git
cd openadapt-desktop
uv sync

# Record a session
uv run openadapt record --task "Demo task"    # Ctrl+C to stop

# Scrub PII, review, and upload
uv run openadapt scrub <CAPTURE_ID> --level basic
uv run openadapt approve <CAPTURE_ID>
uv run openadapt upload <CAPTURE_ID> --backend s3

# Other commands
uv run openadapt list                         # List captures
uv run openadapt review                       # Show pending reviews
uv run openadapt storage                      # Show disk usage
uv run openadapt health                       # Show memory/disk health
uv run openadapt cleanup                      # Enforce storage limits
uv run openadapt config                       # Show current configuration
uv run openadapt backends                     # Show available backends
```

## Architecture

```
Tauri Shell (Rust + WebView)        Python Engine (sidecar / CLI)
+----------------------------+      +---------------------------+
|  System tray icon          |      |  cli.py (CLI entry point) |
|  Start/stop recording      | IPC  |  controller.py            |
|  Settings panel            |<---->|    -> openadapt-capture   |
|  Upload review UI          | JSON |  scrubber.py              |
|  Consent dialogs           |      |    -> openadapt-privacy   |
+----------------------------+      |  db.py (SQLite index)     |
                                    |  storage_manager.py       |
                                    |  upload_manager.py        |
                                    |  review.py (egress gate)  |
                                    |  monitor.py (health)      |
                                    |  audit.py (network log)   |
                                    |  backends/                |
                                    |    s3, hf, wormhole, fl   |
                                    +---------------------------+
```

The Python engine works standalone via the CLI. When the Tauri shell is built, it communicates with the engine via JSON-over-stdin/stdout IPC.

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `openadapt record [--quality standard] [--task "..."]` | Start recording (Ctrl+C to stop) |
| `openadapt list [--limit 10] [--status captured]` | List captures |
| `openadapt info <ID>` | Show capture details |
| `openadapt scrub <ID> [--level basic\|standard\|enhanced]` | Scrub PII from capture |
| `openadapt review` | List captures pending review |
| `openadapt approve <ID>` | Approve scrubbed capture for upload |
| `openadapt dismiss <ID>` | Skip scrubbing, accept PII risks |
| `openadapt upload <ID> --backend s3\|huggingface\|wormhole` | Upload capture |
| `openadapt backends` | List available backends |
| `openadapt storage` | Show storage usage |
| `openadapt health` | Show memory/disk health |
| `openadapt cleanup` | Run storage cleanup |
| `openadapt config` | Show current configuration |

## Recording Review State Machine

Every recording must pass through a review gate before any data can leave the machine:

```
  CAPTURED (raw on disk, blocked from ALL egress)
     |
     +-- scrub --> SCRUBBED (pending user review)
     |                |
     |                +-- approve --> REVIEWED (scrubbed copy cleared)
     |
     +-- dismiss --> DISMISSED (user accepted PII risks)
     |
     +-- delete --> DELETED
```

**All outbound paths are gated** -- not just storage uploads, but also VLM API calls, annotation pipelines, federated learning gradient uploads, and Magic Wormhole sharing. The single enforcement point is `review.py:check_egress_allowed()`.

## Storage Backends

| Backend | Use Case | Cost | Delete? |
|---------|----------|------|---------|
| Local only | Air-gapped / offline | Free | Yes |
| AWS S3 | Enterprise | ~$0.023/GB/mo | Yes |
| Cloudflare R2 | S3-compatible, free egress | ~$0.015/GB/mo | Yes |
| HuggingFace Hub | Community dataset sharing | Free (public) | Yes |
| MinIO | Self-hosted S3-compatible | Free (self-hosted) | Yes |
| Magic Wormhole | Peer-to-peer ad-hoc transfer | Free | N/A |
| Federated Learning | Model improvement without data sharing | Free | N/A |

Enterprise users can verify that unwanted backends are excluded at the binary level (`strings openadapt-engine | grep huggingface` returns nothing in enterprise builds).

## Project Status

**v0.1.0** -- The Python engine is **fully functional end-to-end** as a standalone CLI. 106 tests pass, 0 skipped. See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the full design document.

### What's working

- **Full recording pipeline**: record -> scrub -> review -> upload via CLI
- **Recording controller**: wraps `openadapt-capture`, crash recovery, state tracking
- **PII scrubbing**: regex (basic), Presidio NER (standard/enhanced), image scrubbing
- **Review state machine**: DB-persisted egress gating with audit logging
- **Storage management**: SQLite index DB, hot/warm/cold tiers, tar.gz archival, cleanup
- **Upload manager**: persistent queue, egress checks, multi-backend dispatch
- **Storage backends**: S3 (boto3), HuggingFace Hub, Magic Wormhole -- all implemented
- **Health monitoring**: memory (psutil) and disk monitoring with daemon threads
- **CLI**: 13 commands via argparse (`openadapt record/list/scrub/approve/upload/...`)
- **Audit logging**: append-only JSONL log of all network activity
- **CI**: 106 tests passing on all platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux) x (Python 3.11, 3.12)

### What's next

- [ ] Pause/resume recording (requires openadapt-capture support)
- [ ] Build the upload review UI (Tauri WebView)
- [ ] Tauri IPC wiring (Rust <-> Python sidecar)
- [ ] PyInstaller sidecar bundling
- [ ] Native installers (DMG, MSI, AppImage)
- [ ] Auto-update via Tauri updater plugin
- [ ] Upload scheduling (cron/idle)
- [ ] Bandwidth limiting (token bucket)
- [ ] zstd compression for warm-tier archives
